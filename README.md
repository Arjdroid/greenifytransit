Project Details: 
A mobile application that helps users plan out trips and everyday transit to be more environmentally friendly while still retaining convenience and low travel times. 

The app allows users to input their route plan with the starting point and destination for which the app then analyses the distances, transit times, convenience and carbon emissions for different applicable modes of transport on the same route. 

Subsequently, the app suggests different possible route plans, prioritising plans that have a balance of time taken, comfort and convenience and carbon emissions, providing the user with multiple choices based on their preference.

Additional features include the option to track a user’s overall carbon emissions every month, which the user can then choose to offset by purchasing carbon offsets within the app, choosing between multiple offset projects as per the user’s preference and a social area which gamifies the emissions reduction process.
